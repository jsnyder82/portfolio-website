## Welcome

Hello! I'm **Jayna**, a statistics & data science major with a passion for data visualization, public health, biostatistics and storytelling with data.

I'm a senior at SDSU (go Aztecs!) and I absolutely love San Diego. When I'm not on my computer, I love being outside, biking around the bay, going to workout classes, crocheting, and just yapping with my friends. I'm also a big coffee lover, and currently work part time as a barista :) 

I'm starting this website (in August 2025) to be a collection of my projects, thoughts, and overall learning in data science. Whether you are a future employer, a supportive friend or family member, or just curious about me and what I do, thank you for visiting.
