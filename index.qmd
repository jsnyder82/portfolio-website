## Welcome

Hello! I’m Jayna, a data science student who loves blending stats with creativity. I get excited about building projects that make a difference and making data useful (and fun!), through thoughtful design. I want my work to help people, and I love bringing joy and energy to the process.

I'm a senior at SDSU (go Aztecs!) and I love San Diego. When I'm not on my computer, I love being outside, biking around the bay, practicing yoga, crocheting, and just yapping with my friends. I'm also a big coffee lover, and currently work part-time as a barista :) 

I'm starting this website (in August 2025) to be a collection of my projects, thoughts, and overall learning. Whether you are a future employer, a supportive friend or family member, or just curious about me and what I do, thank you for being here.
