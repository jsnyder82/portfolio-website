## Welcome

Hello! I'm Jayna, a statistics and data science senior at SDSU (go Aztecs!) with a passion for computational biology and public health. I'm an undergraduate researcher in SDSU's Disease Modeling Lab, where I work on mathematical methods for understanding how infectious diseases spread. What excites me most is using data to make complex topics more understandable and, ultimately, to help people.

Outside of research and coursework, you'll find me biking around the bay, practicing yoga, crocheting, or attempting to learn latte art at my part-time barista job. I love San Diego and bringing joy and curiosity to everything I do.

I started this site to document my projects, ideas, and learning as I finish my senior year and move toward a career in biotech and biostatistics research. Whether you're a future collaborator, a recruiter, a friend, or just curious — thanks for stopping by.
