## Welcome

Hi! I'm **Jayna**, a statistics & data science major with a passion for data visualization, design, and storytelling.

I'm a senior at SDSU (go Aztecs!) and love San Diego. I want to stay here for the foreseeable future.

I'm starting this website to be a collection of my projects, thoughts, and overall learning in data science, visualization, and storytelling. Whether you are a future employer, just interested in my projects and pretty graphics, or want some insight into a gen z's thought process, thank you for visiting!
