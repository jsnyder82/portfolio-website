Here are some of my favorite data projects that showcase my skills in analysis, visualization, and design:

- **EDA & ggplot2**: Exploring the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency in the `mpg` dataset.
- **Clustering & PCA**: Customer segmentation using mall spending data.
- **Logistic Regression**: Predicting Titanic survival with tidy modeling tools.
- **Interactive Maps**: Built with `leaflet` to visualize dengue cases by region.

Each project links to GitHub and includes a visual summary.
